***Description***
Head & Tail is a fast-paced, coin-toss based cricket game designed for quick gameplay. Players guess Head or Tail and choose numbers from 1 to 6. If both players choose the same number, the batsman is out; otherwise, the chosen number is added to the score.
The game is designed for singleplayer (Player vs Computer) and multiplayer (Player vs Player) modes. It records scores, match results, and player performance automatically.
